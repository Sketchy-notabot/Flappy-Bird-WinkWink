# FLAPPY BIRD WINK
Have you ever been too lazy to move your hands to play a game? Are you tired of quick aiming and virtually running around in games?
Then this is the game for you.

It's basically Flappy Bird but you jump by **winking/blinking**. No high-end requirements such as minimal physical energy or motivation. As a bonus, you get to practice winking.
Uses OpenCV to detect an eye blink to make the bird jump. The graphics are made with pygame
